Project Geni and modules
--------

### Assumptions:

- Ride for 4 people(adults, children, and senior citizens)
- Electric Vehicle (rather than a combustion engine)
- Reliable Internet Connectivity
- No sensors breakdown(Sensor rechecking module is not added yet)
- Family of the passengers in AV and their Medical Records(in case of a patient), Vehicle Experts, and Health Experts are on the MechCloud
---------
Presenting to you the three pillars of this technology:

## MechCloud
It takes in parameters including:
- Status Code(more about this at the end of the document)
- Mood Matrix
- Health Matrix
- Priority Matrix 
- Patient or Passenger Medical History
- Nearby Experts
  - AV experts
  - Health Experts
  - Charging Stations
- Current Route Data:
  - Air Quality Index
  - Climate & Temperature Data
  - Natural Disasters 
## GENI-AI (General-purpose, Emotional and Naturally Interactive-Artificial Intelligence)
- Mood Monitoring System
  - Songs Selection
  - Interactive Support
  - Talk to an Expert(Medical or Mental Health or Counselor etc)
- Health Monitoring System
  - Pulse Sensors
  - Proximity Sensor
  - Visual input from Camera
  - Backend Algorithms
  - Summon the medics
    - Calling an ambulance to the Current Location
    - Connect to Health Experts instantly
    - Reach a hospital if feasible
- Speed Monitoring System
  - Car Data
    - Speed of the car
    - Status of the tyres
    - Battery Status 
  - Passenger Data
    - Mood of the passengers
    - Health of the passengers

## ComfyWheels

This module works with the linear electric motors or similar actuators to provide the passengers with a smooth ride, no matter how uneven the road is, and how many potholes there are on the route. 

This system works with the following things:
- Actuators
- Sensors(Lidar, and Kinect Sensors) to detect potholes or bumps
- Algorithms to make a response to reduce the effect
